SCORCHED
Every tile player touches turns to fire
	- tiles have associated health bars (player can run over the tile a total of x times before it gets destroyed)
touching same tile again kills player (or the tile just gets destroyed)
dash movement using shift + cardinal direction (diagonals?)


LEVEL DESIGN
parallax on all levels - moutains/cliffs/ in background?
key levels where grabbing a key unlocks the warp to access the end of the level
timer levels - stepping on plate or shooting flame at target allows access to warp for limited time
ice tiles which allow for stepping on twice - 2 health
boss battle to wrap it up? - tiles with 5 health 
powerups/enemies?
Some levels - especially lava land could have tiles which are already scoched (0 health)

Plan:
Today
Parallax of levels
lava tiles - grassland only
rigidbody

Tomorrow 
Game logic
	keys
	player interacting with level
	warps
	level design
	
Day after
Lava tiles - all
scorched trees and terrain design
levels - all regions
